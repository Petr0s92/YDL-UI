![image](https://i.imgur.com/PqBRRHg.png)

Simple GUI writen in HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) and PHP.
No python or annoying dependency management. Install youtube-dl via apt and unzip the UI to yout htdocs!

# Installation

That is pretty straight forward. Just install youtube-dl and make it so it can be globally run using the command "youtube-dl".
The easiest way to do this is by using `apt install youtube-dl`.
After that just put the contents of the .ZIP file somewhere on your Webserver Directory.

Thats all!
	
# Known bug: RRMDIR tries to delete the JS and the CSS folder. Will fix today!
